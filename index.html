    <p class="descript">Sweden is in the geographical region known as Scandinavia in northern Europe. Lush, large forests cover half of the country and over 100,000 lakes dot the landscape. The lakes, and over 24,000 islands, are all open to the public through Sweden's tradition of right to public access.

        Sweden is 977 miles (1,572 kilometers) long and is bordered by Norway on the west and Finland to the east. Three stretches of water separate Sweden from Denmark—the Skagerrak, the Kattegat, and the Öresund straits.</p>

    <p class="descript">Ice cream is a common dessert product that is produced through the pasteurization and homogenization of blended dairy products, (typically milk, condensed milk, butterfat, and cream). Other ingredients such as sweetening agents, flavorings, stabilizers, emulsifiers, colorings are also added to the mix. Occasionally, fruits, nuts, variegates, candy pieces, and other condiments are added to make a desired ice cream flavor. The process then involves freezing the mixture and incorporating air. The addition of air is called overrun and contributes to the lightness or denseness of ice cream. Without air, ice cream would be similar to a frozen ice cube. The ice cream is then placed into its packaging container. Finally, ice cream is cooled down to a holding temperature of less than -13°F (-25°C) as quickly as possible.</p>

        More than a decade after James Cameron‘s Avatar became the highest-grossing film of all time in 2009, audiences are getting ready to return to Pandora.
        
        “It sounds kind of nuts, the process,” the director told Entertainment Weekly in December 2021 about the long-awaited sequel. “I mean, if Avatar hadn’t made so much damn money, we’d never do this — because it’s kind of crazy.”
        
        Avatar 2: The Way of Water will take place in and around the ocean, which conservation advocate Cameron has long been fascinated with. “I do the ocean thing when I’m not making movies,” he added. “So if I could combine my two greatest loves — one of which is ocean exploration; the other, feature filmmaking — why wouldn’t I?”
        
        The original Avatar introduced audiences to the Na’vi, the people who lived in the rainforests of Pandora who were attempting to protect their home as humans invaded to mine the valuable mineral unobtanium. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a disabled Marine who becomes involved in the Avatar Program with the intent to make peace with the Na’vi warriors, soon discovers the widespread damage that the military is causing to Pandora. He joins Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) in a quest to expel all the humans and save the beloved Tree of Souls.</p>
